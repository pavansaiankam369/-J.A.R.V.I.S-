# Voice Assistant using Python

This project implements a voice-controlled assistant using Python, which responds to voice commands and performs various tasks such as searching on Wikipedia, opening websites, playing YouTube videos, and more.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pyttsx3
- speech_recognition
- wikipedia
- pywhatkit
- webbrowser

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
   ```
   
2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install pyttsx3 speech_recognition wikipedia pywhatkit
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the script `main.py` to start the voice assistant.

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

2. Once the assistant starts, it will greet you based on the time of the day and await commands.

3. You can interact with the assistant by saying its wake word ("jarvis" in this case) followed by your command. For example:
   - "jarvis, who are you?"
   - "jarvis, open Google"
   - "jarvis, play Despacito on YouTube"

4. The assistant can perform tasks such as:
   - Answering questions using Wikipedia.
   - Opening websites like Google or YouTube.
   - Playing specified songs or videos on YouTube.

## Features

- **Voice Recognition**: Uses `speech_recognition` to understand voice commands.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Utilizes `pyttsx3` to provide audio responses.
- **Web Interaction**: Opens web browsers and searches websites based on user commands.
- **Information Retrieval**: Fetches information from Wikipedia.
